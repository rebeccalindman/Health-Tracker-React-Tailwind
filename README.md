# Accessibility & User Experience

## üöÄ Custom Form Validation

### ‚ùì Why Custom Validation?
By default, browsers only highlight **one missing field at a time** when using the `required` attribute. However, we want users to **see all missing fields at once** when they attempt to submit the form. This improves user experience by making it clear which fields need attention.

To achieve this, we **disabled native browser validation** (`noValidate` on `<form>`) and implemented our own validation logic.

---

### üîç How It Works
- When the user clicks **submit**, all required fields are checked.
- If a required field is **empty**, it is outlined in **red** and an error message appears.
- If the user enters a value, the red border disappears instantly.
- Once all required fields are filled, the form submits successfully.

---

### ‚úÖ Expected Behavior
1. **Before submission:**  
   - The form looks normal.
   
2. **After clicking submit with missing fields:**  
   - All missing required fields turn **red**.
   - An error message appears under each missing field.

3. **When fixing an error:**  
   - As soon as the user enters a value, the **red border disappears**.

4. **After fixing all errors and clicking submit:**  
   - The form submits successfully.
